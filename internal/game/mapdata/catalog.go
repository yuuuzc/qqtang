// RollWallItems applies the local server's deterministic policy to the
// server-owned half of the original map format: each embedded rule is gated
// by its probability, then chooses a quantity in its inclusive range. The
// original client proves that GAME_BEGIN supplies these quantities and that
// ItemSeed is used only for the native coordinate shuffle; it does not contain
// Tencent's retired server-side random-number algorithm. Keeping this policy
// deterministic makes a captured GAME_BEGIN replayable without presenting the
// xorshift sequence below as recovered official-server behavior.
//
// The local policy additionally reserves a map-gated floor for the
// three native base attributes (SceneID 1/2/3) whenever the selected map
// actually defines them. The fallback for one rule is
// 3+ceil(players/2), no more than its map maximum. A normal probability roll
// above this floor is preserved when conservation-first transfers let every
// eligible type reach its floor. If any type remains deficient, guarantee mode
// jointly compresses all three target quantities into at most half of the
// ordinary hidden-item cells. Outside guarantee mode, successful native rolls
// may exceed that half-wall boundary. The final combined roll is always bounded
// by all ordinary hidden-item cells. Rule-owned objective carriers are a
// separate native pool and are not counted in this capacity.
